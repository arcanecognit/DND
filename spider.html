		<p>This area is for the players to follow up on their leads from the town. They are not required to do all of the activities in this area. </p>

		<p>Our players last found themselves in the middle of <a href="">Phandalin</a> fighting the greedy mage Iarno Albek, a fallen member of the <a href="">Lords Alliance</a> whom Sildar Hallwinter had been searching for. After defeating the mage and procuring his magic staff made completely of glass.</p>

		<p>Iarno had been sent by the Lords Alliance to establish order in Phandalin, instead deciding to set up a criminal gang and take power for himself. Recently hired by the <a href="">Black Spider</a> for the use of his thugs, Iarno's silence drew the attention of Sildar Hallwinter, another agent of the Lords Alliance.</p>

		<p>Iarno was reading his mail and plotting evil things when his rat familiar wilkins saw all of you enter his laboratory. Wilkins poofed out of existance when shot, but Iarno had just enough time to flee. His bugout bag missing, he franticaly barreled to town to gather suplies when he was confronted by his old friend Sildar.</p>

		<p>You all showed up a short time later, and after finally killing the fleeing Iarno, saving Sildar, have rested and set off up the triboar trail to <a href="">Thundertree</a></p>

		<h4>Thundertree</h4>
	<!---	
		<p>Near the place where the Neverwinter River emerges from Neverwinter Wood stands the abandoned village of Thundertree. Once, this was a prosperous community on the outskirts of the forest, wealthy from the work of its woodcutters and trappers. Then thirty years ago, the eruption of Mount Hotenow to the north devastated Thundertree. In the wake of the natural disaster, a plague of strange zombies swept over the area, killing or driving off those who survived the eruption.
		
		Though most of the zombies have long since crumbled to dust, strange magic permeating the area has mutated the local vegetation into new and dangerous forms. Few people dare to venture into the ruined village now, and those who do so seldom stay long â€” with two notable exceptions. The druid Reidoth (see area 4) visits Thundertree from time to time, keeping a wary eye on its dangers. Cultists have also arrived recently (see area 13) to treat with a dragon that claims Thundertree as its domain</p>

		<p>
		Gradually, the trail becomes an old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings choked in vines and brush. Ahead of you, in the middle of the settlement, rises a steep hill, upon which stands a stone tower with a partially collapsed roof and an adjoining cottage. A dirt road hugs the base of the hill and wends its way between old stone houses, many of which are roofless ruins with interiors open to the weather. Other buildings appear more or less intact. The whole place is eerily silent.
